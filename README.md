# odin-recipes
This is my first website project consisting of a recipe page

In this project I demonstrated my ability to create a basic html webpage.
To do this I used both absolute and relative links for images and html files.
I also utilised my knowledge of headers, paragraphs, ordered/unordered lists, and strong/em elements to create a readable recipe website.

This project has also helped reinforce my knowledge of the usage of git-hub
